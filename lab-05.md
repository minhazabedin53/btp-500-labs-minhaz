## Due: In class at end of lab period where this lab was assigned

## Setup:

- Find a partner or two
- On the sheet of paper given to you write your name
- **Each person must submit their own sheet**
- Work on the following problem.  If you need extra sheets of paper, please let me know.
- Explanations can be done verbally, no need to write it down...

   
## Heap Insertion:

Each person in team takes turn explaining how to inserting the values below into an initially empty minheap.  Draw the heap after each insertion.

10, 6, 5, 4, 9, 16, 7, 18, 22, 1, 3, 8, 2, 11


## Heap Removal

Suppose you are giving the following array representation of a heap.:

[60, 30, 36, 20, 22, 27, 15, 14, 17, 21, 5, 24, 26, 6, 12, 11, 3, 10, 9, 13, 16]

1. Draw the heap
2. Each person in the group explains how to remove a value from the heap.  Draw the heap after each removal. Each person demonstrates how to do removal twice (so if you have team of 3, you have to remove 6 values, a team of 2 removes 4 values)


## Make Max Heap

Suppose you were given the following array:

[11, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 4, 10, 1, 3, 15, 13, 14]

1. Draw the complete binary tree represented by the array above
2. Each person in the team takes a turn performing heapify on a value, explain how it works (starting with first non leaf from the back) do this until we end up with a maxheap.
3. Redraw heap after each heapify operation.

## Heap Sort

Start with the maxheap you have from the makeheap section

- what is the array form of the heap?
- Each person in the team will take turn doing the following:
  1. Swap root with bottom right most node
  2. Perform heapify
- write the array form of the heap after each number gets processed
- Do this until you have a sorted array (sorted in ascending order)



## Submitting your lab

In order to get a mark for this lab, you must submit:

* the lab sheet that is given to you at start of the lab at the end of the lab period
